### Chapter 1 Notes
- Python is a scripting language that is used to write small programs or automate tasks
 - **Pros**:
   - Python's suppport for various libaries, like pandas and NumPy, has allowed it to be popular choice for data analysis.
   - Python is used by researchers and software developers, which increased efficiency between academia and software engineering team.
 - **Cons**: 
   - Python runs slower than complied languages.
   - Global interpreter lock (GIL) does not allow interpretors to run Python instructions concurrently.
 - **Libraries**
   - NumPy - Numerical Python - used for numerical computing
   - pandas - panel data - used to create high-level data structures and functions; provides indexing functionality
     - DataFrame - a tabular, column-oriented data structure with rows and columns 
     - Series - a one-dimensional labeled array object
   - matplotlib - used for plots and 2D data visualization 
   - Jupyter - interactive and exploratory computing environment 
     - allows "execute-explore" workflow rather than "edit-compile-run" workflow    
   - scikit-learn - machine learning toolkit
   - statsmodel - statistical analysis package
