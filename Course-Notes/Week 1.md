# Week 1 Notes

## Lecture Notes - Date: Jan 28, 2021
1. Overview of Blackboard
   - Essential information regarding the course is available on Blackboard.
2. Overview of Github
   - All repositories should have a README.md
   - Markdown format is used to format text files so that it is easily readable by the readers. 
3. Overview of Deepnote
   - Practice environment like Jupyter Notebook. 
   - ipynb = Interactive Python Notebook
   
### Tuturial of Deepnote
1. Create .py file.
2. Enter code in the .py file.
3. Create Terminal by clicking the (+) button. 
   - #pwd - present working directory
   - #ls - listing
   - #python [filename].py - python interpretor; runs the .py file. 
   - #whoami - owner of the current login session
   - #vi - visual editor; displays the file
   
### Tips
- Always start with a Markdown file and include assignment #, name and date. 
- Deepnote/Jupyter notebooks are good for displaying steps. 
- Save work as .ipynb file and upload to Github

## Reading Notes

### Chapter 1 Notes
- Python is a scripting language that is used to write small programs or automate tasks
 - **Pros**:
   - Python's suppport for various libaries, like pandas and NumPy, has allowed it to be popular choice for data analysis.
   - Python is used by researchers and software developers, which increased efficiency between academia and software engineering team.
 - **Cons**: 
   - Python runs slower than complied languages.
   - Global interpreter lock (GIL) does not allow interpretors to run Python instructions concurrently.
 - **Libraries**
   - NumPy - Numerical Python - used for numerical computing
   - pandas - panel data - used to create high-level data structures and functions; provides indexing functionality
     - DataFrame - a tabular, column-oriented data structure with rows and columns 
     - Series - a one-dimensional labeled array object
   - matplotlib - used for plots and 2D data visualization 
   - Jupyter - interactive and exploratory computing environment 
     - allows "execute-explore" workflow rather than "edit-compile-run" workflow    
   - scikit-learn - machine learning toolkit
   - statsmodel - statistical analysis package
